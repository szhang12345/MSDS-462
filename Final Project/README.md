# Final Project: Real-Time Image Captioning

Image Captioning is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing. 
Automatically generating captions of an image can be viewed as a task that is very close to the heart of scene understandingâ€”one of the primary goals of computer vision. 
This project will apply this technique on edge devices to help users explore surrounding items at real-time using cameras. 
This project achieve this goal by using both Natural Language Processing models and deep learning computer vision models to generate the captions.

This project uses a pre trained model from Mathur et al. (2017) paper, Camera2Caption: A Real-time Image Caption Generator, and then converts the final model to TensorFlow Lite format so that it can be deployed on Android devices through Android Studio.
