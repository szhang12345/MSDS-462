## Course Description

A review of specialized deep learning methods for vision, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Students work with raw image files, including digital representations of photographs, hand-written documents, x-rays, and sensor images. Students process image data, converting pixels into numeric tensors for subsequent analysis and modeling. The course illustrates real-world applications for visual exploration, discovery, and navigation, and for image classification, facial recognition, remote sensing, and medical diagnostics. This is a project-based course with extensive programming assignments.

## Course Objectives

● Decide on the appropriate level of abstraction for applying Computer Vision to a business problem.
● Build computer vision models from scratch. These will include Tensorflow 2.0 based Deep Learning models.
● Apply Computer Vision models to edge-based Machine Learning hardware. These will include Intel Movidius.
● Apply Computer Vision models to edge-based Machine Learning hardware that work with Managed ML Systems. These will use AWS DeepLense and AWS Sagemaker.
● Use Cloud-Native Computer Vision APIs.
